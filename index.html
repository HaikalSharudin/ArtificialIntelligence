            <p class="col-12 text-center text padding ">Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart
                 machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary 
                 science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a 
                 paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. </p>

        Artificial Intelligence can be classified in several ways. The first classifies 
        the AI as either weak AI or strong AI. Weak AI also known as narrow AI, is an AI 
        system that is designed and trained for a specific type of task. Strong AI, also 
        known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human 
        cognitive abilities so that when presented with an unfamiliar task, it has enough 
        intelligence to find a solution. The Turing Test, developed by mathematician Alan 
        Turing in 1950, is a method used to determine if a computer can think like a human, 
        although the method is controversial. The second example is from Arend Hintze, an 
        assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at 
        Michigan State University. He categorized AI into four types

</div>

<div class="container-fluid padding bg1">
    <ul class="container text">
        <li>
            <p>Type 1: Reactive Machines. An example is Deep Blue, an IBM chess program that can 
                identify pieces on the chess board and can make predictions accordingly. 
                But the major fault with this is that it has no memory and cannot use past 
                experiences to inform future ones. It also analyzes possible moves of its 
                own and its opponents. Deep Blue and AlphaGO were designed for narrow 
                purposes and cannot easily be applied to any other situation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Type 2: Limited Memory. These AI systems can use past experiences 
                to inform future decisions. Most of the decision-making functions in the 
                autonomous vehicles have been designed in this way.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Type 3: Theory of mind: This is a psychology term, which refers 
                to the understanding that the other have in their own beliefs and intentions that 
                impact the decisions they make. At present this kind of artificial intelligence 
                does not exist.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Type 4: Self-awareness. In this category, AI systems have a sense 
                of self, have consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their 
                current state and can use the information to infer what others are feeling. 
                This type of AI does not yet exist.

                         voice-activated computer that we interact with on a daily basis. She helps us find
                          information, gives us directions, add events to our calendars, helps us send messages
                           and so on. Siri is a pseudo-intelligent digital personal assistant. She uses machine-learning
                            technology to get smarter and better able to predict and understand our natural-language questions

                        and its uncanny ability to decipher speech from anywhere in the room has made it a 
                        revolutionary product that can help us scour the web for information, shop, schedule
